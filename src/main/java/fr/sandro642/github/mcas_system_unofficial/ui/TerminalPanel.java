 * @description The Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) is an automated system designed to enhance the flight characteristics of an aircraft, particularly regarding its behavior at high angles of attack. This system plays a crucial role in the stability of the aircraft during certain maneuvers, especially when an aircraft is at low speed or climbing, and helps to prevent a stall.
